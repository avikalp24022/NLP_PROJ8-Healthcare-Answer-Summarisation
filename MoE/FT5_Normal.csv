This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement.

The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve damage to the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, leading to inflammation and scar tissue formation (sclerosis). This inflammation can slow or block nerve impulses, resulting in a variety of symptoms that can vary in duration and intensity. MS has a genetic component and is more prevalent in certain geographical regions. Researchers believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may trigger the disease. MS is characterized by inflammation and damage to the white matter tissue in the central nervous system.",Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition characterized by multiple sclerosis (MS).

1855693,what is thephysiology of thirst?,,INFORMATION_SUMMARY,"Thirst and drinking are essential for maintaining body water balance and survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry mouth and the need for water, resulting from factors like dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, medications, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves motor activities leading to liquid ingestion and is influenced by factors like temperature and taste. Thirst may vary in discomfort, being diminished in some elderly persons and inappropriate in compulsive water drinkers. Nursing research on thirst assessment, nursing diagnoses, and interventions for altered thirst behaviors is limited. The sensation of thirst indicates the body's need for water, triggered by factors like dry or salty food and dry air. Relief through water ingestion is temporary if thirst results from generalized water depletion. The body, comprising about three-fourths fluids, requires adequate daily fluid intake to prevent dehydration, a condition interfering with metabolism and functions, ultimately fatal. Unnatural thirst in disorders like fever and diabetes is caused by rapid reduction of body fluids. Thirst sensation is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, triggered by dehydration, leading to antidiuretic hormone release and signaling to drink and limit water excretion. Thirst is related to the salt concentration in the blood, and feeling thirsty indicates approximately 1% dehydration.","For information purposes, the physiological mechanism of thirst is influenced by the pH of the blood."
